Don't know if this will reach anyone, but it's here, just in case. Who knows, it may appear to the right person at the right time. If you aren't aware, things are *a little* crazy...very crazy, actually. DUMPSTER FIRE **x10.** The world is smack-dab in the middle of a pandemic that is bring it to a halt. I won't go into detail, there's been enough coverage (good and otherwise). This space is for resources to lift your spirits and provide something of value during these uncertain times. It's definitely random and I'll probably add more to this - we may need this for another time - but it's something.

**[Twitter](twitter.com)** - hear me out: outside of misinformation and the stranger-than-fiction stories surrounding the pandemic (buying up exorbitant amounts of *essential* supplies to later sell for exorbitant prices :expressionless: :unamused:), tweeps have really come together to support, encourage, and entertain (check out #LiveIdes) each other. I LOVE to see it.

**[Care for Your Coronavirus Anxiety](virusanxiety.com)** - I'll let them tell it:
> In two days, we ([Shine App](twitter.com/ShineText)) as a team partnered with Mental Health America to create a project we’re *so* proud of, and it’s aptly called Care for Your Coronavirus. We hopped on phone calls, gathered in Google Docs, and conversed in conference rooms to create a comprehensive resource for you to care for your mental health during these uncertain times. Consider [virusanxiety.com](virusanxiety.com) your mental health toolkit: You can listen to free meditations, read reliable articles on caring for your mental health, ask experts questions about your mental health, take an anxiety screening quiz, and so much more. We’ll be updating it regularly as we all take this day-by-day.

I'm trying to #StayTheFHome and be productive, so I'm backing up photos that I probably should have backed up sooner. Here's one from a cruise I took in 2018:

**YouTube videos**
* [chilledcow](https://www.youtube.com/chilledcow) - good for zoning out and relaxing, see also [Chillhop Music](https://www.youtube.com/user/Chillhopdotcom) and [DreamyCow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuw1VDsmOWOldKGLYq6AkVg)
* search "cute animals" and consider your day well-spent
* exercise videos - again, hear me out: it's easy to spend the whole day in bed and **EYE** would not fault or shame you for that (beds are great) but, if you want to get the blood flowing and feel better, there are *free* videos available. Go crazy.

**MAKE things** - food, art, whatever! **get creative!** If I can manage to find the rest of the ingredients I need, I might make these to snack on while at home: [Salted Chocolate–Tahini Bliss Balls](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salted-chocolate-tahini-bliss-balls)

**[Virtual Museum Tours](https://www.travelandleisure.com/attractions/museums-galleries/museums-with-virtual-tours)** - found on Twitter; I know that a round-trip ticket for $100 to some beautiful destination sounds *really* tempting, but #StayTheFHome, seriously. Grab your computer and a HDMI cord, or if you're fancy, plug in the VR, and soak in some exhibits.

**Support a bookstore** - get yourself some #QuarentineReads and support a business that won't be receiving a bailout :upside_down_face:
...May I suggest [Harriet's Bookshop](https://conversationswithharriett.bigcartel.com/) and [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/)

**Shop/eat local** - maintain social distancing, request contactless delivery and AGAIN, support those who really need it.

...more to come...
