I've have managed to almost make it a year without writing anything. I had hoped that things would be vastly different than what has/is actually happening...

...but, it hasn't been *all* bad. As a moment of grounding myself in gratitude and providing an update (two birds, FTW!), i've decided to make this post.

* we have a new president (*WOO!*)
* i've celebrated a year at my new job (which i've spent the majority of WFH but, I digress)
* i'm fully vaccinated (barring any potential booster shots)
* i'm the most active i've been as an adult, i'm finally listening to my body, and doing my best to take care of it
* i've been accepted as a LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group [(LEADING)](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/leading/) fellow
* i'm turning 31 (at home)
* there's a pretty strong possibility that i'll be able to safely travel with my mom this year
* "i'm safe **AND** I have what I need" (h/t to Dr. Tykeia Robinson)
