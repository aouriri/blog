*Word of Caution:* Along with my example, you, dear reader, can find quite a few examples from other students from this class by employing a simple search. While these examples are helpful in gaining some idea in crafting the IOP, if you are currently in this class (INFO 5200), do **NOT** copy and paste, paraphrase, or take any action where your project would mirror an example you've seen. Assuming that much hasn't changed since I was enrolled in this class, it would be better to ask questions during the chats and review the recorded lectures for insight.
