Since the beginning of 2018, I've done my little part to make Wikipedia articles more reputable. Thanks to the help of a co-worker who was very much into Wikipedia, I've learned how to add citations and edit/proofread articles. I've participated in #1Lib1Ref, and other edit-a-thons, including the <a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/AfroCROWD,_Schomburg_Center,_Wikimedia_NYC/Schomburg_Center_Black_History_Month_Wikipedia_Edit-a-thon_with_AfroCROWD_(February_16,_2019)/home">Schomburg Center Black History Month Wikipedia Edit-a-thon with AfroCROWD</a>. During this particular edit-a-thon, I've joined Women in Red ([WiR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red)) with the hopes of creating my own article on author and scholar Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi. 

**Next edit-a-thon**: [Smithsonian American Art Museum - African American Artists Wikipedia Edit-a-thon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/DC/SAAM_African_American_Artists_Wikipedia_Edit-a-thon) - February 17, 2019 :heavy_check_mark:
