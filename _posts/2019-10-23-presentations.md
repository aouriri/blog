### Curation + Metadata
This presentation was created to fulfill an assignment requirement for INFO 5223 - Metadata for Information Organization and Retrieval. Students were given a topic and tasked to create a presentation of how their topic employed or benefitted from metadata; my topic was Digital Curation.

### Reimagining Data with Deep Maps
This presentation serves as a digestible look at the research work students had been doing in INFO 5970 - Advanced Topics Seminar in Information Science I. My research topic was employing [Deep Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_map), using [Activity Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_theory), as a means to reuse or reimagine available data. I briefly explain the purpose of my research, a possible research question, and background on the terms/topics of my research.

### Managing the Humanities: Research Data Management in the Arts & Humanities
Created to accompany my final paper (and for extra credit), this presentation serves as a summary for the topic of managing research data from the different disciplines in the arts and humantities. Looking mainly to UK services and tools, I examined how librarians, data managers, and data librarians are working to educate and support researchers in the arts & humanities on how to manage their data.
