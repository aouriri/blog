In honor of the [ALCTS Preservation Week](http://www.ala.org/alcts/preservationweek) initiative and to apply what I'm learning in the Preservation Planning and Implementation for Digital Curation (INFO 5843) course, I've decided to tackle a long overdue project: digitizing family photos. Of course, I don't have to stress the importance of digitizing anything physical, especially personal effects, but it is crucial in my case because my mother's portion of the family photos are lovingly stored in a large beach bag...*yeah.* So the plan is as follows and honestly, who knows how long this is going to take :grimacing:

- **Scan all the photos** at least the *really* important ones
- Organize, since img250.tif isn't really descriptive, amirite?
- Make 'em pretty: crop, light touch-ups
- SHARE
  - find a CMS that my family members can view the images and even share stories and/or comments about them
- Rinse and repeat for other contributed photos

I'm just gonna leave this here for encouragement.
