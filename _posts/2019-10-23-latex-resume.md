In perusing the "Explore" section of GitHub, I found a repo created by [mrzool](https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate) for a CV created using LaTeX. Needing to spruce up my résumé and finding the look of it visually pleasing, I decided to kill two birds by updating my résumé and learn a little about LaTeX. Like many things, LaTeX is pretty straight-forward until it's not. I had some challenges. Thankfully, there have been many before me and I was able to put it together, see link on my [home](aouriri.github.io) page. I can definitely see how flexible and orderly it would be to craft documents with LaTeX and hope to do just that...once I really figure out how things work.
