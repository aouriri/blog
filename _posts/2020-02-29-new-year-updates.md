So, a lot has happened since my last post. So much so, that it's taken me two months to write this. :woman_shrugging:

Quick updates:
* One month down at new job
* Made a thing for my office (below) ![digitaldisplay](https://aouriri.github.io/blog/assets/ER-TFoyWkAEcRtq.jpg)
* Enrolled in Metadata Implementation through Library Juice Academy for March
* Attending the 2020 RDAP Summit
* Find new blog layout?? **FOUND** new blog layout.
* Still adulting, even though some days I want to stay in bed and clear out my Netflix/Hulu lists

That's it for now. I'll try not to let this go the way of my numerous attempts to journal over the years.
